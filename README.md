My Wallpaper Collection

Here's my entire wallpaper folder. 

## Where Did I Get These?
Some of the images are borrowed from [DistroTube](https://gitlab.com/dwt1), while most of them are borrowed from [LukeSmith](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz), who, in turn, got most of the wallpapers from [Imgur](http://imgur.com) or [/wg/](http://4chan.org/wg).

## Sorting

Things are sorted in general folders, with an `Unsorted` folder for those I haven't gone through.

## Ownership

Because most of these images are from sites like Imgur and /wg/, I have no
way of knowing if there is a copyright on these images. If you find an image
hosted in this repository that is yours and of limited use, please let me know
and I will remove it.
